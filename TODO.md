# TODO

1. Implement login functionality.
2. We need to implement a functionality to refresh the tokens right before the token expires.
3. Implement signup functionality.
4. Implement the home screen.
5. Make sure that your application carefully draws screen based on the user Role.

## Bugs
- Sometimes the front sends refresh request for no reason (investigate this).
- On initial page load the role isn't set.
- Loading spiner on initial load doesn't exists, we should have initial load to finish the refresh token request.
