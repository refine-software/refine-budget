# TODO

- [x] Implement login functionality.
- [x] We need to implement a functionality to refresh the tokens right before the token expires.
- [ ] Implement signup functionality.
- [x] Implement the home screen.
- [x] Make sure that your application carefully draws screen based on the user Role.

## Bugs

- [x] Sometimes the front sends refresh request for no reason (investigate this).
- [ ] On initial page load the role isn't set.
- [ ] Loading spiner on initial load doesn't exists, we should have initial load to finish the refresh token request.
